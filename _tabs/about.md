Hello! I'm Amin, a dedicated Rust developer with over three years of experience. 
I specialize in system-level programming, network programming, and creating developer tools. 
My passion lies in understanding complex systems and simplifying them through code.

## My Philosophy
I believe in the power of open-source software and the importance of education. 
Many of my projects are designed to be educational, helping others understand complex systems and concepts. 
I'm always eager to learn and improve, and I enjoy the challenge of turning complex problems into simple, elegant solutions.

## Let's Connect
I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations. Whether you have a project in mind, need some advice, 
or just want to chat about Rust, feel free to reach out to me.
